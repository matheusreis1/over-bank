## overbank

Yes, this project is about overengineering. It's been created from a university project to learn about microservices. And I'll use it to play and learn about different technologies that I don't know nothing about. For instance, this project will be all about refactoring, wish me luck :)
It was first created using Java, Angular and NodeJS.
